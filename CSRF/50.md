## Exploitation
- The system only checks if what you submitted is part of the CSRF token. <br>
  - This means that if you only submit "1" you have a good chance of randomly guessing a possible token.
  - But this would require more permutation rules in Burp which is complex.

- The easier process would be doing as given [20.md](https://github.com/R0h1t3/Hackxpert-Labs/blob/main/CSRF/20.md)
  - Screenshot is not uploaded since the result has a suprise for you. Hack it!
