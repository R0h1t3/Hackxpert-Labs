Let's solve this

## Exploitation
- Click the **Inspect** option and inspect the code.<br>

- This challenge only checks that the token is not empty. So try replacing the token with any random token and execute. 
  - If that doesn't work, use burp as used in the [20.md](https://github.com/R0h1t3/Hackxpert-Labs/blob/main/CSRF/20.md)<br>

  <br> And it works.
  
**Note:** For some the first method of replacing with random token may not work.
